# The Unifiers - Unified

## Level of achievement
Apollo II

## Motivation
Open your Telegram application right now - what do you see? Numerous NUS chats and channels that are left unopened, some of which are even muted. You are left overwhelmed and clueless about the latest updates and news, such as bus route changes or event updates. It is difficult to keep track of university information due to the numerous channels available to obtain information.

To add on, it is even harder to identify channels for communication, especially for module discussions or finding items you have lost on campus. As such, we want to initiate a one-stop app for NUS students to keep track of information and to provide a safe and centralised channel for common discussions with peers and seniors.
